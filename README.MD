# React TypeScript Mini-Library Template

This is a very minimal simplified template for creating React component library with TypeScript.


## Minimal Setup

1. Update the **name**, **version**, **description**, **author**, **licence** and whatever fields in [package.json](package.json) that needs to be customized according to your needs.
2. Write your components anywhere under the [src](src) directory but make sure to export them in the index file right under the [src](src) folder.
3. Run ```npm install``` (and also install any additional dependencies if needed)
